Java ATM interface enables users to perform banking transactions, including withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and bill payments. It guides users through each step, prints receipts, and updates account information. Users can change their account details and it includes security features like automatic logout and data encryption.


The ATM interface should be designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate for users.

The interface should display relevant information about the user's account, such as their account balance, recent transactions, and any pending transactions.

The interface should allow the user to perform common banking tasks, such as withdrawing cash, depositing cash or checks, transferring funds between accounts, and paying bills.

The interface should also include security features, such as requiring the user to enter a PIN (personal identification number) to access their account, and logging out automatically after a period of inactivity.

The interface should provide error messages or alerts to the user if they make a mistake or their transaction cannot be completed for any reason.

The interface should be able to communicate with the bank's backend system to update the user's account information and process transactions.

The interface should be able to print transaction receipts for the user's records.

The interface should also provide options for users to change their account details, such as updating their contact information or changing their PIN.

Finally, the interface should be designed to be accessible to users with disabilities, including features such as text-to-speech capabilities and adjustable font sizes.

When a user approaches the ATM, they are prompted to insert their bank card.

Once the card is inserted, the interface asks the user to enter their PIN to access their account.

After the user enters their PIN, the interface displays their account balance and any recent transactions.

The user can then select the transaction they wish to perform, such as withdrawing cash, depositing cash or checks, transferring funds between accounts, or paying bills.

The interface guides the user through each step of the selected transaction, prompting them to enter the required information (such as the amount of money to withdraw) and confirming their selections before processing the transaction.

If the user makes a mistake or enters incorrect information, the interface displays an error message and prompts them to correct their input.

Once the transaction is complete, the interface prints a receipt for the user's records and updates their account balance and transaction history.

If the user wishes to change their account details or PIN, they can select the appropriate option from the main menu and follow the prompts.

The interface also includes security features such as logging out automatically after a period of inactivity and encrypting sensitive user data.
